    "Art is a journey", much like how our life is a journey. My art became the way it is today because of my experiences in life.
    I experienced doubt, self-determination, and hating mysef for things I've endured. But that's what makes life worth living,
    because the relief and pride I felt when I resolved a problem, when I finally got out of that dark place â€” I've come to
    finally learn to love my life.

        Now imagine a robot were to live that life for you. It won't be worth living. Especially since machines can lways get things
        done on first try no matter what. Where's the pride? Where's the commendable hardwork and preserverance when all they do is
        perfect here, perfect there?
